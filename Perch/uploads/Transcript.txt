Good morning, everyone. Uh, today we are going to, uh, dive into, um, an introductory lecture on Quantum Mechanics. So, uh, let's get started. Quantum Mechanics, it’s...uh, fundamentally, it's a part of physics that, um, explores and describes the, uh, behaviors of energy and, uh, matter on the, uh, atomic and subatomic levels. Uh, before we, um, delve deeper, I'd like to, uh, emphasize the, um, historical context. So, um, classical mechanics, right, it worked perfectly well for, uh, describing macroscopic objects. But, uh, scientists, they began noticing anomalies at the, um, at the very small scale. Now, uh, Max Planck, uh, he’s a key figure here. In 1900, he, uh, proposed that, um, energy is quantized. It, uh, it means that, uh, energy could only, um, take on specific, discrete values. Uh, his work, it, um, it laid the, uh, groundwork for Quantum Mechanics. Uh, moving on, um, another pivotal moment, it, uh, came with, uh, Albert Einstein. He, um, he proposed the, uh, photoelectric effect, uh, explaining that, um, light could be described as, uh, particles, or, um, "quanta" of energy. This, uh, this was, uh, revolutionary because it, um, it challenged the, um, classical wave theory of light. Now, uh, the principles of Quantum Mechanics, they are, uh, they are quite, um, counterintuitive. Uh, for instance, the, um, the principle of, uh, superposition. It, uh, suggests that particles can exist in, um, multiple states simultaneously until, uh, they are observed. It's, uh, it's a bit like, uh, Schrödinger’s cat, a thought experiment, um, where a cat in a box is, um, is simultaneously alive and dead until, uh, the box is opened. And, um, let's not forget about, uh, entanglement, a, uh, phenomenon where particles become, um, interconnected, and the state of one, uh, instantly influences the state of another, um, regardless of the distance separating them. Uh, Einstein, he, uh, famously called it "spooky action at a distance." Uh, Professor, how does, um, Quantum Mechanics affect, uh, our understanding of the universe? Oh, that's, uh, that's a great question. Um, Quantum Mechanics, it, uh, fundamentally changes our, um, our understanding. It, um, it has, uh, implications for, uh, everything from, um, the structure of atoms to, uh, the workings of, uh, computers, and even, um, the origins of the universe. So, uh, it's, um, incredibly important. Uh, looks like we're, um, running out of time. So, uh, we'll continue this, uh, discussion in our next lecture. Please, uh, make sure to, um, review the slides I've, uh, uploaded and, um, read the assigned chapters. Uh, any, uh, questions before we wrap up?Alright, then. Uh, thank you, everyone. Don't forget to, uh, sign the attendance sheet before you, uh, leave. Have a, uh, great day.
